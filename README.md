# Bypass-Detection-On-Synthetic-Images
Spoofing detectors for synthetic images through applying noise to synthetic images by neural networks.

## Without gradient information from the detector
The method of applying random noise multiple times is used to test the detector, so that the gradient information of the detector is not needed.
