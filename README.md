# Bypass-Detection-On-Synthetic-Images
Spoofing detectors for synthetic images through applying noise to synthetic images by neural networks.  
The detector: [see here](https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/DIRE).(This is the previous detector, now we have used our own trained detector.)

# Update
**_2023.10.7_**  
1. The open source data set([see here](https://genimage-dataset.github.io/)) was used to train its own detector, and the noise processing network model trained on this data set had a dramatic excellent effect.
2. Using the captions of coco2017 as prompt, 100000 images are generated by using the stable-diffusion model as our own data set. However, the current generated images are not effective, so the parameters during generation will be adjusted in the future.
3. In the treatment of the previous tentative noise, the soft threshold function is added by referring to the deep residual shrinkage network, which filters out the impurity noise to a certain extent.
4. The whole process of testing the detector and finally returning the direction of the target is integrated into a new module, so that the quaternary structure of generator-processor-trier-detector is obtained.

**_2023.9.9_**  
Added v2 version with more mathematical rigor and comments.

**_2023.9.9_**  
1. The previous model works so well because it exploits a flaw in the detector: if you change the border color of the image, the detector doesn't work properly. However, once the border of the processed image is cropped, the recognition rate is not reduced at all. Now, by changing the distribution of the trial noise (from a Poisson distribution to a Gaussian distribution), we have managed to get the processor to work without exploiting the detector bug, although the reduction in recognition rate is not as high as before.
2. The interference noise is eliminated by denoising the trial noise, so that the true gradient descent direction is much more prominent than before.
3. The optimizer was changed from Adam to AdamW for better learning.(We also tried SGD+momentum, but it didn't optimize very well here.)

**_2023.9.7_**  
A new method is applied: the gradient direction is estimated by the weighted sum of multiple trial noises. Now, even without the gradient information from the detector, we can achieve even better results. Recognition rate from 64% to 19%, at the same time without any loss of image quality.  

**_2023.9.5_**  
The method of applying random noise multiple times is used to test the detector, so that the gradient information of the detector is not needed.However, the effect of this method is poor: the decrease of recognition rate is small, and the loss of image quality is too high.
